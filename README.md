## Design & Philosophy

My intention with this first iteration at a portfolio was to make a page which would be minimalistic, but contain modern CSS elements. It's designed around a Black/White/Red color pallette, and features a fixed nav bar and smooth scrolling. The entire page is built in flex containers, making it naturally responsive to varied display sizes.

As I wrote it, I became more and more aware of the limitations of flexboxes, and would go on to learn about grid styling. Future iterations of my portfolio will mix Grid for macro elements and flexboxes for smaller elements. 

I struggled most with the Work cards, which will be completely redone on future iterations. While the fill the technical requirements I had for them (serving as functional links to other work with images and titles), I wasn't ultimately able to make them as stylish as I'd envisioned. 

I'm most happy with the navigation elements and the text segments. My use of spans with slightly increased fontsize and crimson coloring really makes the "About Me" section pop.

### Important Note:

The work contained in the "Work" section of this page are both placeholders. While they DO represent work that I personally completed, they are either just refactored code (in the case of HoriSEOn) or incomplete projects (in the case of CSS Snippets). 

I intentionally left one of the work boxes with "Image Placeholder" and "Placeholder Text" to better show how the card is formatted, and to avoid linking to compeltely unaffiliated work.
